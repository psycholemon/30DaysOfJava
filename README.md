# Welcome to 30 DAYS OF JAVA!

During this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Java, a popular programming language.

This course was also developed by a student, so I will be learning along with you.

There will be projects within this course.

Each day, you will learn a **new** Java concept. As you move on throughout this course, each day will be more about projects rather than concepts. By the end of this course, you will master the fundamentals of Java, and get a grasp of other programming languages as well.

**Enjoy!**
